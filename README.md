An unofficial browser extension for Google Chrome that enhances the browsing experience on Crunchyroll with powerful, persistent filtering options.

## üåü Key Features

- **Filter by Minimum Rating**: Only show series with a rating of 4.5 stars or higher.
- **Filter by Minimum Episodes**: Hide shorts and single-episode series by setting a minimum episode count.
- **Filter by Dub Language**: See only the shows that have a specific dub track available (e.g., German, English, etc.).
- **Persistent Settings**: Set your default filters in the options page, and they will be automatically applied every time you visit Crunchyroll.
- **Dynamic Content Support**: Filters are automatically re-applied when you scroll down and new shows are loaded on the page.
- **Built for Maintainability**: CSS selectors and patterns are centralized, making the extension easier to fix if a Crunchyroll update breaks it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting / It Broke!

This extension depends on the HTML structure and class names of the Crunchyroll website. When Crunchyroll updates its website, the extension may stop working correctly.

**The most common reason for breakage is a change in the website's CSS selectors.**

We have made this as easy to fix as possible for advanced users. All the critical selectors are located in a single file:

`/src/config/selectors.js`

If the extension breaks, it is likely that one or more of the selectors in this file need to be updated to match the new structure of the Crunchyroll website. You can do this by inspecting the HTML on Crunchyroll's pages and updating the values in this file.
